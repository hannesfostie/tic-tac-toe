# Take-home project

## Choice of project

I immediately ruled out the Space Invaders game, because it sounded like it would be a little too frontend heavy for me to pull of in a reasonable amount of time.

I initially wanted to give the LISP parser a shot, but when I realized I know nothing about how that actually works it occurred to me that it would be incredibly difficult to look up answers without actually seeing implementations as well, which defeats the purpose.

As such, Tic Tac Toe it is!

## Goal-setting

My assumption with this assignment is that it's not about delivering a perfect solution. It's about showing that I know Ruby, sharing my thought process, and communication.

As such I'm not going to spend too much time getting the game to be exactly right, let alone look great.

I decided to use a library for some of the heavy lifting in terms of user input as it made things a bit quicker and less error-prone. At that point, all my code needs to do is keep some sort of representation of the board and the status of the game and then loop until either a winner is found or the board is full.
